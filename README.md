# Quant Sandbox
Quant Sandbox is an educational forecasting playground that makes applying machine learning to noisy, real-world data intuitive and transparent.

Users can experiment with real datasets using different machine learning models, adjusting features and timeframes through sliders and interactive visualizations. The focus is on understanding model behavior, assumptions, and tradeoffs rather than optimizing for prediction accuracy.
